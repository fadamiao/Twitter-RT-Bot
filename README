This is a simple bot for Twitter.
Its main and only function, so far, is retweet a message with a specific hashtag with a mention of its user.

Please help me to improve it, because it does not know much about python, despite having it written in this language.

Some interesting features for the future:
-> Make a list, maybe with regex, with the hashtag.
Because he makes an exact comparison of the hashtag that is placed on the script today.

-> Make a error log.

-> Auto Follow-Friday
Complete with a list for something pre-programmed, but also enable the response to new people and an thank you

-> Use a conf file
Using a configuration file, maybe with XML, to set tokens, user, hashtag, list to the FF

-> User Interface
Make an administration interface in order to manipulate the configuration file, display the error log
